argo problem
allowed fts: getc, ungetc, printf, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, isdigit, fscanf, __OPENCL_MEMORY_SCOPE_WORK_ITEM

instructions:
create a function that parses a json in structure declare in the argo.h
Protoype:
int	argo(json *dst, FILE *stream);

dst is the pointer to the AST that you will create. Stream is the file to parse (man FILE)
The function reurns 1 in success or -1 in failure.
if unexpected token is found print in stdout
"Unexpected token %c\n" or "Unexpected end of input\n" if the token is EOF
Only handle numbers, strings, and maps
Numbers basic int like in scanf(%d)
you must handle escaping in the strings only for backslashes and quotations marks (no \n, \u or anything else)
you dont need to handle spaces in the input(so the are consider invalid tokens)
